## Summary of Investigation


From the data, we can conclude the following:

Question 1: What are the average ratings of movies by their respective genres? From the graph, we can tell that documentaries are the highest rated movies. We can also see that Horror movies are rated lowest.
Question 2: How much revenue is generated relative to movie rating categories high, moderate and low? We can tell that on average, higher rated movies make the most revenue while lower rated movies make the least.
Question 3: Which movie genre generates the highest and lowest revenue?From the bar plot we can tell that adventure movies and science fiction movies generate the most revenue while TV movies and foreign films generate the least. Using this plot and the one from question 1 we can conclude that higher ratings do not necessarily mean that a genre will produce high revenue.Documnetaries, which were the highest rated movies produce the third least amount of revenue of all the genres
Question 4: Does a higher movie budget mean that a movie will be rated highly overall? From this plot, we can answer the question with, no, a higher movie budget does not necessarily guarantee that a movie will get higher ratings
Question 5: Which year were more movies released? From the plot, we can see that there were more movies released in 2014 since 1960. This graph also shows that there is a massive increase in movie productions over the years.
